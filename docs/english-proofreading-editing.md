# Proofreading & Editing

Even the most skilled writers need an editor. I can your text from good to great. I will read your document with an eye not only for grammar and spelling but also for flow, comprehension, accessibility and flair. I can help you cut a text down for a new format (maybe turn a journal article into a blogpost?) and restructure to enhancing storytelling.

Or maybe English is your second language, and you need a native speaker's schooled eye to make sure the text reads smoothly and conveys exactly what you want it to.

I can rework existing content for new audiences and alter tone and emphasis. Editing can work magic, and you'd be surprised all you can do with the content you already have with my help. This is also a great way to get lots of content even on a tight budget. Contact me and we'll come up with a plan!
