# Translation

This is the heart of what I do. I transform your German texts into English, taking great care to preserve message and meaning, but also making sure that the final English text reads perfectly native. This service combines all my skills—fluent German, native English, deep intercultural understanding, strong voice and creativity.

I place great emphasis on continuity and accuracy, and I'll make sure your text is perfect. I use the latest translation memory technology and can import language glossaries and styleguides to ensure that my language aligns perfectly with your corporate ídentity.

When you order a translation from me, you're getting so much more than what you would get from an automated service. In fact, I am really taking your text and transforming it using my copywriting skills. I am happy to deliver translations that stay absolutely aligned with the German original texts, but I think you'll see, if you give me a bit of creative leeway, your English texts will have a special flair.
