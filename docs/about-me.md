# About me

Hi! My name's Emily, and I grew up in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. I've been living and working in Germany since 2005 and Munich is where I call home.

My qualifications:

* B.A. Political Science/Italian—Northwestern University, Chicago, USA
* M.A Intercultural Communication & Cooperation—Munich University of Applied Sciences
* 10+ years translation/copywriting experience

## What else?
