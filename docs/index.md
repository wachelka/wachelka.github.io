## Translation

Translation is so much more than just reflecting a text in another language. When I translate, I convey not only pure meaning—but also  essence, cultural nuance, plays on words, humor—whatever the text requires. That's why my translations always sound like they were written by a native speaker, and you'd never guess they'd been translated. True transcreation.  [translation](/german-english-translation).
