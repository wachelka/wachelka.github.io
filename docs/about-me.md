# About me

Hi! My name is Emily Wachelka, and I grew up in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. I've been living and working in Germany since 2005 and Munich is where I call home.

My qualifications:

* B.A. Political Science/Italian—Northwestern University, Chicago, USA
* M.A Intercultural Communication & Cooperation—Munich University of Applied Sciences
* 10+ years translation/copywriting experience
* German: fluent, English: native

## What else?

 Languages and new cultures have been my passion since I went on a three week homestay to Spain when I was 16—and I've never looked back. That experience propelled me to my semester abroad in Padua, Italy, and, after that, my scholarship year as part of the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange for Young Professionals here in Munich. And here I still am.

I can't wait to translate/write/edit for you!
